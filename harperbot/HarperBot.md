# PR Bot with Gemini AI

This bot automatically analyzes pull requests using Google's Gemini AI and posts code review comments.

## Features

- Analyzes code changes in pull requests
- Provides code quality feedback
- Identifies potential issues and bugs
- Suggests improvements
- Posts detailed analysis as PR comments
- **NEW**: Can author code changes directly (auto-commit suggestions, create improvement PRs)

## Setup

1. **GitHub App**
   Create a GitHub App for HarperBot to post comments as a dedicated bot:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/apps (for personal accounts) or your organization's settings to create a new GitHub App.
   - Create a new GitHub App named "HarperBot"
   - Set permissions: Repository permissions - Contents: Read, Issues: Read & Write, Pull requests: Read & Write
   - Generate and download a private key
   - Install the app on your repository

2. **Required Secrets**
    - `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key
    - `HARPER_BOT_APP_ID`: The App ID from the GitHub App settings
    - `HARPER_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key content (paste the entire .pem file content)
    - `WEBHOOK_SECRET`: A secret string for webhook signature verification (used in webhook mode)

3. **GitHub App Installation (for Webhook Mode)**
   Install the HarperBot GitHub App on your repository. This is required for the recommended Webhook Mode.

## How It Works

### Webhook Mode (Recommended)
This is the preferred mode for new installations. It uses a centralized deployment for scalability and ease of management.

### Workflow Mode (Legacy)
*This mode is deprecated in favor of Webhook Mode. Support will continue for existing users, but new features and improvements will prioritize Webhook Mode.*

1. Run the setup script: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bniladridas/friday_gemini_ai/main/bin/setup-harperbot | bash`
   (Use `--update` to update existing, `--dry-run` to preview, `--repo URL` for custom source)
   Or manually copy `harperbot/` and `.github/workflows/harperbot.yml` to your repository
2. Set required secrets: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `HARPER_BOT_APP_ID`, `HARPER_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY`
3. When a PR is opened/updated, the workflow runs and posts analysis

### Webhook Mode (Recommended)
1. Install the GitHub App on your repository
2. The hosted bot automatically receives webhooks for PR events
3. Analysis is posted directly without repository-specific setup

### CLI Mode
Run manually: `python harperbot/harperbot.py --repo owner/repo --pr 123`

*Note: The local webhook server uses Flask's development server, suitable for testing. For production self-hosting outside Vercel, use a WSGI server like Gunicorn.*

## Migration from Workflow Mode to Webhook Mode

Webhook Mode is recommended for better scalability and ease of management. Benefits include:

- **Centralized deployment**: One Vercel instance handles all repositories
- **No per-repository secrets**: API keys and credentials managed in one place
- **Automatic updates**: Deployments update all connected repositories
- **Better performance**: Serverless architecture scales automatically

### Migration Steps

1. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Fork this repository
   - Connect to Vercel and deploy the `webhook-vercel` branch
   - Set environment variables: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `HARPER_BOT_APP_ID`, `HARPER_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET`

2. **Install GitHub App**:
   - Install the HarperBot GitHub App on your repositories
   - Remove repository-specific secrets and workflow files if desired

3. **Verify**:
   - Test with a new PR to ensure analysis posts correctly
   - Workflow Mode can remain as fallback during transition

## Security

- **Webhook signature verification**: All webhook requests are validated using HMAC-SHA256
- **GitHub App authentication**: Uses secure app tokens with minimal required permissions
- **Environment variables**: Sensitive keys are stored securely in Vercel/env vars

## Code Authoring Features

HarperBot can now author code changes directly as a contributor to repositories:

### Auto-Commit Suggestions
- Automatically applies code suggestions to PR branches
- Creates commits with fixes and improvements
- Reduces manual work for developers

### Improvement PRs
- Creates new PRs with additional improvements
- Generates comprehensive enhancement suggestions
- Works alongside existing PR review process

### Configuration
Set `enable_authoring: true` in `harperbot/config.yaml` and configure:
- `auto_commit_suggestions`: Apply suggestions directly to PRs
- `create_improvement_prs`: Generate improvement PRs
- `improvement_branch_pattern`: Naming pattern for improvement branches

### Security Note
Authoring features require write access to repositories. Ensure proper permissions are granted to the GitHub App or token.

## Customization

Modify `harperbot/config.yaml` to adjust:
- Analysis focus: 'all', 'security', 'performance', 'quality'
- Gemini model: 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'gemini-2.5-pro'
- Temperature and token limits
- Authoring features (enable/disable auto-committing and improvement PRs)

## Troubleshooting

**Workflow Mode:**
1. Check GitHub Actions runs for the workflow
2. Verify secrets are set in repository settings
3. Ensure PR has write permissions

**Webhook Mode:**
1. Check Vercel function logs at https://vercel.com/[your-account]/[project]/functions
2. Verify GitHub webhook delivery status in repository settings > webhooks
3. Ensure environment variables are set correctly in Vercel dashboard
4. Confirm the GitHub App is installed and has repository access
5. Verify GitHub App webhook URL and secret match Vercel deployment

**Common Issues:**
- Invalid Gemini API key: Check quota and key validity
- Webhook signature errors: Ensure webhook secret matches
- Permission errors: Verify GitHub App has required permissions
